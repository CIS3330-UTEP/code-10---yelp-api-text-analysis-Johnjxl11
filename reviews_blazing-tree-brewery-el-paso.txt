Great selection, atmosphere, great selection of music... Do not give up finding this hidden gem!

Will be back when in El Paso!

I am not a beer drinker!! But I had the coconut one OMG so good. I loved it. A  fun hangout

Excellent beers, great service, food is not bad too! We got the burgers which were cooked perfectly, simple classic, and seasoned fries. Tried the coconut...
